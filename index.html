				Unsurprisingly, I often get asked about my name. I was born in Nova Scotia, Canada and my parents gave me a name of the local <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mi%27kmaq">Mi'kmaq</a> people. This is the story that inspired them:

				<h2>Nokome and the Ice King</h2>
				<p>
				Now, while Glooscap was engaged in his struggle with Winter, his
				People were having a sad and bewildering time.
				<p>
				In the summer that Glooscap left them, the Wabanaki were happy.
				The running brooks were brimful of fish, and the meadows sweet
				with berries. Game of all kind abounded in the forest, and as
				long as the birds sang in the thickets-- as long as the streams
				laughed and glistened and the soft air was fragrant with flowers-
				-the Indians' days were merry and long.
				<p>
				But when the days grew shorter and the red leaves of the maples
				became brittle and dropped from their branches, the Wabanaki
				began to be afraid. What was happening to their lovely land? The
				air had grown chill. The bark walls of their wigwams let in great
				drafts, and their handsome clothing of scraped and decorated
				doeskin no longer kept them warm.
				<p>
				The ground grew hard and a white mist began to fall. It sifted
				through the open places in their lodges and made all damp and
				dismal. The Indians had never seen snow before, and it frightened
				them. Who had made it? Where had it come from? Some thought it a
				spell thrown upon the land by an evil giant, and of course they
				were right. At that very moment, though they did not know it,
				their Great Chief was setting out to challenge the Ice King,
				Winter.
				<p>
				Greater still was the Wabanaki's dismay when ice stilled the
				brooks and rivers, and the fish were lost to them under the ice.
				The earth became sick and famished with cold, as deeper and
				deeper fell the snow, and thicker and thicker froze the river.
				The Wabanaki hunters crept out of their half-buried homes each
				morning to hunt for food, but in the white silence they found
				little or no game, and the least effort exhausted them. Weak from
				hunger and numbed by cold, many fell and lay silent in the snow.
				And all this bitter time Glooscap, under Winter's magic spell,
				lay sleeping and could not help them.
				<p>
				But at last the Great Chief awoke and summoned Coolpujot, who
				made the sun to shine again and the snow to melt. Alas, however,
				by now only a few of the Indian families were still alive. In one
				of these was a youth named Nokome, stronger and more resourceful
				than the rest. Late in the months of cold he had thought to
				fasten branches on his feet so he could walk on top of the snow,
				and in this way, wearing the first snowshoes, he had been able to
				snare sufficient game to keep himself and his neighbours from
				starving.
				<p>
				Warmed and heartened by the sun, Nokome watched gladly as the
				snow melted from the hills and the ice from the river, and all
				floated down with a gush of laughing water--all except one huge
				ice cake near the shore. This lodged in a crook of the river and
				refused to melt, making the air cold all around it. Nokome
				decided to be rid of it.
				<p>
				Arming himself with a heavy pole, he boldly attacked the monster
				ice cake. As he pounded away, he sang merrily, "Come on, villain,
				do your worst. Freeze me if you can!"
				<p>
				At every blow, the enemy gave way a little, until finally it
				tumbled over on its back and was borne away by the current. As it
				slid downstream, Nokome heard a loud harsh cry.
				<p>
				"Who dares defy the Ice King? Woe to him who tries Winter's
				strength!"
				<p>
				Nokome was startled at first, but called back stoutly, "Away with
				you, Winter, and never come back!"
				<p>
				"I shall come back, never fear!" the voice roared. "Coolpujot's
				charm will not last long, and then we will discover who is
				Master! "
				<p>
				As the ice cake slipped out of sight, Nokome laughed, and soon
				forgot the Ice King's warning, thinking the fine warm days would
				last forever. But he was wrong. In time, as Coolpujot's charm
				lost its power, the earth grew cold again. Once more the snow
				fell and the Indians shivered and grew hungry. Nokome and the
				other hunters had all they could do to keep alive, and even so a
				few of them perished before Glooscap found Summer and the warm
				days came again.
				<p>
				Nokome saw that something must be done. Each time the Ice King
				came, more people died. In time, if this continued, all the
				Wabanaki would perish. Nokome would have braved anything to keep
				Winter away for good, but what could an ordinary mortal do
				against a giant?
				<p>
				Then, suddenly, it came to him what he must do. Had not Glooscap,
				their Great Chief, told them that whenever his people sought him
				diligently in time of trouble, he would help them? Why had he not
				thought of this before? He, Nokome, would seek out Glooscap and
				ask him to destroy Winter!
				<p>
				Now this was a very brave thing for Nokome to decide, for no
				Indian had seen Glooscap since the early days of summer, or knew
				exactly where he lived. However, the Indians in their fishing
				expeditions had travelled as far as the mainland and were
				acquainted with the lobster-shaped peninsula we now call Nova
				Scotia. Glooscap's canoe had been seen once in Minas Basin, on
				the far side of that peninsula, and it was rumoured that the
				Master lived somewhere near the green and red mountain of
				Blomidon.
				<p>
				So, one day, as the red leaves fluttered from the trees, Nokome
				set out alone in his canoe, crossing the strip of sea which
				separated Uktamkoo from the mainland, and entered the mouth of a
				river. He followed this river to its source, a lake in the South
				Mountain. After crossing this lake, he lifted his canoe from the
				water and carried it on his back to a second lake which he also
				crossed--and so on, from lake to lake in this way, until he came
				to a stream which led directly down into Minas Basin. Now, far
				across the Bay, he saw Blomidon, purple in the mist of distance.
				<p>
				It was a long voyage across the Bay, but at last Nokome ran his
				canoe ashore on Blomidon's beach and gazed up at the red
				sandstone cliff studded with evergreens and purple stones. He
				felt suddenly very sure that Glooscap was somewhere near at hand.
				He would climb the mountain and from its summit be able to see
				all the territory for miles around. Thus he would discover where
				Glooscap had his lodge.
				<p>
				Nokome began climbing. The red stone was slippery and he slid
				back time and again. Ground juniper scratched his face and
				scraped his hands, but he struggled on. Up and up, until at last
				he reached the top. Tired and dirty, and gasping for breath, he
				fell face down upon the grass.
				<p>
				"Kwah-ee!"
				<p>
				The Indian word of greeting echoed in the still air, and Nokome
				felt a giant hand help him to his feet. There before him stood
				the immense figure of Glooscap, with beyond him a great wigwam
				set in the midst of birch trees and guarded by two huge dogs, one
				black and one white. Nokome had found Glooscap's lodge.
				<p>
				"O Great Chief," cried Nokome, "kill the giant, Winter, or he
				will destroy us all!" But Glooscap shook his head.
				<p>
				"I have promised Winter he may rule for six months," he said. "Be
				thankful you have Summer the rest of the year."
				<p>
				"But, Master," Nokome stammered sadly, "even in six months the
				Ice King can kill many people."
				<p>
				"True," said the lord of men and beasts. "But if you do as I say,
				you will find you have the power yourself to defeat Winter."
				<p>
				Nokome begged eagerly to be told what to do, but even as Glooscap
				spoke, his heart sank. He had expected to receive a magician's
				power, but instead the Great Chief spoke of gathering sunflowers
				and cutting wood. When at last he ceased speaking, Nokome thanked
				Glooscap, hiding his disappointment as well as he could, and
				departed. He paddled wearily back across the lonely miles,
				convinced his journey had been in vain. Glooscap had put him off
				with empty words.
				<p>
				Arriving home at last, he saw with alarm that already the dry
				leaves lay thick on the ground, and he had noticed that whenever
				the leaves fell, Winter came soon afterwards. He must try the
				remedy Glooscap had suggested, for he could think of nothing
				else. Springing ashore, he called the people and told them what
				to do.
				<p>
				Listening to his words and following his example, the Indians
				covered their bark wigwams with skins of fur, then laid heavy
				spruce boughs at the cracks and edges. They cut down all the
				driest trees, split them into slender sticks, and stored the wood
				in their lodges. Then they made themselves new clothes, not
				scraping the fur from the hide as they had always done before.
				The clothes were ugly and bulky, but warm.
				<p>
				Then the children were set to picking fruits and berries, and the
				women to cutting up meat, and while the meat smoked over the
				fire, Nokome taught the women how to make snowshoes of ash
				splints fastened together with thongs of rawhide. Then the dried
				meat and fruits were stored in the lodges with the wood. Last of
				all, Nokome squeezed oil from sunflower seeds and stored the oil
				in a basket lined with hardened clay.
				<p>
				Now at last, if Glooscap spoke the truth, they were ready for the
				Ice King, and only just in time. For all through the forest the
				giant's breath could be felt, stiffening the water in the brooks
				and coating the ground with frost. The cold air stung the
				Indians' throats and hurt their chests, and the earth felt like
				iron under their moccasins. Then the snow came, drifting over the
				hunting trails, and at last--the Ice King himself!
				<p>
				Nokome, in his wigwam, saw the giant at his door. The Ice King's
				hair was like a snowdrift. Icicles hung from his beard, and in
				his cold blue hand he held a glittering spear.
				<p>
				Bending his head with an icy clatter, he entered the wigwam, and
				when he spoke, his cold breath made Nokome shake from head to
				foot.
				<p>
				"Kwah-ee, Nokome!" The familiar Indian greeting sounded like ice
				shattering as it fell.
				<p>
				"Come up to the highest place," stuttered Nokome through
				chattering teeth, for it is a matter of pride with the Indian to
				treat any stranger in his home, friend or enemy, with politeness.
				<p>
				The Ice King took the honoured place by the fire and seated
				himself with calm dignity, knowing he had only to remain there a
				short time and Nokome would be dead of cold and exposure. Indeed,
				the youth's body already felt so stiff and chilled, he wondered
				if he could ever move again. Yet he must! Somehow he managed to
				stir his dull limbs and creep to the fire. He laid a few bits of
				wood on the dying flame and blew upon it feebly.
				<p>
				The Ice King smiled scornfully at his weak labours.
				<p>
				With enormous effort, Nokome managed to lift heavier boughs on
				the blaze, and now the flames began to crackle. Warmed a little,
				and moving more quickly now, Nokome added heavier and heavier
				logs, and the fire shot up higher.
				<p>
				The Ice King scowled and moved back a little.
				<p>
				Now Nokome, feeling life surge through him once more, heaped more
				and more wood upon the fire. The flames roared higher still, and
				the lodge grew hotter and hotter. The Ice King began to gasp, and
				great drops of sweat ran from his brow. Then at last Nokome took
				his precious store of sunflower oil and dashed it upon the fire.
				Up the flames shot with a roar, to the very peak of the wigwam!
				<p>
				The Ice King could bear it no longer. With a cry of rage and
				agony, he shrank back against the wall of the wigwam. Water
				streamed from his crown and his spear was melting quickly.
				<p>
				"Mercy!" gasped the giant. "Enough! You have won the victory. Now
				let me go!"
				<p>
				Nokome rose and raked away the fire.
				<p>
				"Go then," he cried triumphantly, "and know that, when you return
				hereafter, we will always be ready for you."
				<p>
				"You have conquered me fairly," groaned the giant. "Twice! Now
				you are my master forever." And he fled from Nokome's lodge and
				away from the village.
				<p>
				Then amongst the Wabanaki there was great rejoicing. The people
				praised their Great Chief Glooscap for his wisdom, and made
				Nokome their village chief for his wit and courage. Never again
				would the Wabanaki fear the Ice King's power, for they had
				learned to turn Winter into Summer with their own hands.
				<p>
				And so, kespeadooksit--the story ends.
